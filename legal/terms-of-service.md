## B. Account Terms

### 1. Account Registration

Generally, as a condition of using GitNotebooks's Service, You are required to create an account with GitHub. Note however, that You may use GitNotebooks's Service in read-only mode for public data without creating a GitHub account or registering for GitNotebooks. After creating a GitHub account, You can register with GitNotebooks by authorizing Us to access Your GitHub account in Your name, and You control the scope of the authority granted to Us. If You lose access to Your GitHub account for any reason, You will lose access to Your data and information in GitNotebooks as well.

### 2. GitHub Access

You represent that You are entitled to grant Us access to Your GitHub Account, without breach by You of any of the terms and conditions that govern Your use of the applicable GitHub Account and without obligating Us to pay any fees or making Us subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third party service providers. By granting Us access to Your GitHub account, You understand and agree that We may access and make available any Content that You have provided to Your GitHub account (the “Third Party Content”) so that it is available on and through the Service via Your account, and We may submit and receive additional information to and from Your GitHub account as indicated herein. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all Third Party Content shall be considered to be Your Content for purposes of this Agreement. Depending on the privacy settings that You have set in Your GitHub account, personal information (as defined in the [Privacy Policy](https://gitnotebooks.com/privacy)) that You post to Your GitHub account may be available on and through the Service.

### 3. Required Information

Initially, You are only required to share with Us Your Github account number and the public information associated with it. As You make use of more of GitNotebooks, You will be required to grant access to other information, such as Your email address, repositories, etc. You can revoke previously granted access at any time in GitHub's [application integration settings](https://github.com/settings/installations/42833190).

### 4. Account Requirements

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitNotebooks's Service.

- One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one Account.
- You must be over 16 years of age. If We learn of any user aged 16 or under, We will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If You are a resident of a country outside the United States, Your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, You are responsible for complying with Your country’s laws.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as Your subscription allows.

### 5. Account Security

You are responsible for keeping Your Account secure while You use our Service.

- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under Your Account.
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of Your Account. GitNotebooks cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from Your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You will promptly [notify GitNotebooks](mailto:legal@gitnotebooks.com) if You become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through Your Account, including any unauthorized use of Your authorization token or Account.

### 6. Publicity

We may disclose the fact that an Organization is a user of GitNotebooks, and include its name and trademarks in various promotional materials, such as web pages, social media, and private communications. In connection with the foregoing, You hereby grant GitNotebooks a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual right to use Your Organization’s logos and trademarks in any of our marketing and promotional materials solely for the purpose of identifying You as a customer and promoting our business, including but not limited to on our Service.

### 7. Additional Terms

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to Your use of GitNotebooks. For example, You may be a member of an organization on GitNotebooks with its own terms or license agreements; or You may download an application that integrates with GitNotebooks. Please be aware that while this Agreement is our full agreement with You, other parties' terms govern their relationships with You.

## C. Acceptable Use

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in Your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that Your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

## D. User-Generated Content

### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that You post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of Your User-Generated Content.

### 2. GitNotebooks May Remove Content

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or GitNotebooks terms or policies.

### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If You're posting anything You did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, You agree that You are responsible for any Content You post; that You will only submit Content that You have the right to post; and that You will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content You post.

Because You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, We need You to grant Us — and other GitNotebooks users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.6. These license grants apply to Your Content. If You upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitNotebooks the permissions We need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that You will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.6. The licenses You grant to Us will end when You remove Your Content from our servers.

### 4. License Grant to Us

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant Us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to You and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitNotebooks the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitNotebooks the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service.

### 5. License Grant to Other Users

Any User-Generated Content You post publicly, including comments, may be viewed by others.

If You set Your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, You grant each user of GitNotebooks a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitNotebooks Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitNotebooks as permitted through GitNotebooks's functionality. If You are uploading Content You did not create or own, You are responsible for ensuring that the Content You upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitNotebooks users.

### 6. Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that You upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, You waive these rights and agree not to assert them against Us, to enable Us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4.

To the extent this Agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, You grant GitNotebooks the rights We need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## E. Private Repositories

### 1. Control of Private Repositories

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the user to control access to Content.

### 2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories

GitNotebooks considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to You. GitNotebooks will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that We would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### 3. Access

GitNotebooks personnel may only access the content of Your private repositories with Your express written permission, or to comply with our legal obligations. In the context of Self-Hosted Software, all repository data is entirely inaccessible to GitNotebooks personnel.

When using the GitNotebooks Website services, You may choose to enable additional access to Your private repositories. For example, You may enable various GitNotebooks services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitNotebooks will continue to treat Your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those We need to provide the GitNotebooks Service, We will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, if using the GitNotebooks Website services, We may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of Your private repositories.

GitNotebooks will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## F. Self-Hosted Software

### 1. License to the software

For the term of this Agreement, and subject to the terms of this Agreement, We grant You a non-exclusive licence to install and use the Self-Hosted Software in the ordinary course of conducting Your business.

### 2. License limitations

Without limiting Your rights at law, and subject to any conflicting rights granted by this Agreement, You must not, without our prior written consent:

- reverse engineer, reverse assemble or reverse compile the Software or any part of the Self Hosted Software;
- copy the Self-Hosted Software, in whole or in part, except that You may make copies of Your data where necessary or prudent for Your internal needs and for business continuity and data security; and
